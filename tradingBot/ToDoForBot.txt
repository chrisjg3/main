To Do For Trade Bot:

-paperTrader not importing, not sure why

- Build bot.py to run with buy/sell func in seperate file

- import update py instead of rewriting code

- make code more "bad user" proof - aka make sure 'yes and no' areas reask if not yes or no, and other things along those lines. 

- Break up bot settings functionality 

- Make bot runnable from main file so can compete with bot

- Check if path to modules gets messed up if called from main.py (may need to change to absolute)
