To Do For Trade Bot:

- Build bot.py to run with buy/sell func in seperate file

- import update py instead of rewriting code

- make code more "bad user" proof - aka make sure 'yes and no' areas reask if not yes or no, and other things along those lines. 

- Break up bot settings functionality 

- Make bot runnable from main file so can compete with bot


Also: Add issue of not using Adj Close for the main.py paper trader
