# Welcome to my algorithmic trader!

This project is not yet complete and is currently not functional.
However, the code is pretty clear and can be read to understand how it will work.


## Installation:

This file will work when it is run from a command file in the above directory. I will not expand this section as this file will eventually be only a backend file and will not be something for users to look at (let alone fine installation instructions on).

This section is only here for now because a proper installation section doesn't exist in the project README.
