# Welcome to my Paper Trading Python Program!

It is user friendly and self-explanatory!  It gets live stock prices and it keeps track of your earnings!  
(Version History on README in the paperTrader Folder)

## Coming Features:

I am revisiting this code after spending a while on other projects.  I am currently in the process of applying my new skills to it.  I am currently trying to make it conform more to PEP8 conventions. 

The main paper trading program has been broken down by functionality, I am hoping to do this as well to the trading bot code. It isn't espcially long, but I am doing this for practice of conventions.

Next features will be adding a GUI and finishing that trading bot.

## Using the program:

The program is very user friendly so read the lines that appear and nothing should be too confusing to understand.  You don't need to do anything but run the main.py file.

You edit/add/substact from you portfolio inside the program, just input the correct stock abreviation and the program will fetch the correct information.  There is no need to edit anything else.  

However, if you want to set up some specific conditions in the CSV or start over you can do so by just editting the CSV yourself. If you choose to do this, there are a few things to keep in mind:

1. You cannot move the csv file.  The main.py file must be in the same folder as the csv.

2. You must save it as a csv file.  That is what the code looks for.

Other then that you will be fine.  Edit any of the quantities or money yourself to fit whatever need you have.


## Installation:

Running the main.py file is all you need to run the program, this section is more for those without the knowledge on how to easily do this. 

#### Easiest way to run:

Download this repository onto your computer.

Open a finder window and open the downloaded folder so you see the main.py file. 

Open Terminal and type python3
Then hit enter.

Then go to the finder window and drag the main.py file into the terminal.  

(You should see a path appear, something that looks like user/Downloads/paper_trader/main.py)

Hit enter

This should run the program.


## Other Notes:

Read the READMEs in the individual folders for more information.  Each has a version history and some extra information, including what I am working on within it.

It is more backend notes then user notes, so if you are just interested in running the program that is all you need.
