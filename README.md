# Welcome to my Paper Trading Python Program!

It is super user friendly and self-explanatory!  It gets live stock prices and it keeps track of your earnings!  

## Coming Features:

I am revisiting this code after spending a while on other projects.  It is currently very disorganized and inefficient (since it was built when I was first learning Python.)

The paper trader does work, but expect a lot of changes and rearrangements in the coming weeks.

I will be dividing up the code to help with debugging, adding a GUI, and changing how the program runs to stop the redudencies.  


## Using the program:

The program is very user friendly so read the lines that appear and nothing should be too confusing to understand.  You don't need to do anything but run the file.

<<<<<<< HEAD
You edit/add/substact from you portfolio inside the program.  There is no need to edit anything else.  

However, if you want to set up some specific conditions in the CSV or start over you can do so by just editting the CSV yourself.

If you want to edit your portfolio and have custom stocks or quanitites (or start over completely) you can edit the CSV.  You just have to keep this in mind:

### NOTE: This code is very old (as in before I learned a lot of what I know now) so I am in the process of updating it to more normal standards.

- Changing code to OOP

- Adding a GUI

- As mentioned above, I will make the program a bit more user friendly by having the program add stocks autotically if they have never been in the csv, rather then asking the user, which isn't really necessary.

- I may add a program that scrapes other financial information.  The idea was brought up to you about Quarter Reports.

1. You cannot move the csv file.  The main.py file must be in the same folder as the csv.

2. You must save it as a csv file.  That is what the code looks for.

Other then that you will be fine.  Edit any of the quantities or money yourself to fit whatever need you have.


## Installation:

There are two ways to run this paper trader.  One easy way that works on mac computers and one harder way requires some basic knowledge of the terminal /command promt on a mac computer / windows computer.  I have both below:

#### Easiest way to run:

Download this repository onto your computer.

Open a finder window and open the downloaded folder so you see the main.py file. 

Open Terminal and type python3
Then hit enter.

Then go to the finder window and drag the main.py file into the terminal.  

(You should see a path appear, something that looks like user/Downloads/paper_trader/main.py)

Hit enter

This should run the program.


#### Slightly harder way that requires terminal knowledge:

Download this repository onto your computer.

Open a finder window and open the downloaded folder so you see the main.py file. 

Open the command prompt (Terminal) and type Python3

Insert the path to the main.py file and hit enter

This should run the program.


## Other Notes:

Read the READMEs in the individual folders for more information.  Each has a version history and some extra information, including what I am working on within it.

It is more backend notes then user notes, so if you are just interested in running the program that is all you need.
