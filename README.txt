Hello!

Welcome to my Paper Trading Python Program.  It is super user friendly and self-explanatory!  It gets live stock prices and it keeps track of your earnings!  There is only two things you need to do to get this running.

When you run the Python file, the csv must:
	a) Still be a csv.  You can edit it but always save it to csv (not excel or whatever else)
	b) Be in the SAME folder as the python code you are running
	
That is it! The rest is self explanatory when you run the program.  It explains everything.  


FUTURE PLANS FOR IMPROVEMENT:

- I will likely make a branch that has a simple algorithmic trader bot that using moving averages.  It will be an extension on this code without the buy/sell option (since it would be done by the bot).

- I may add a program that scrapes other financial information.  The idea was brought up to you about Quarter Reports.

- Efficiency improvement.  If you look at the code, I could speed things up (for example by only getting the live prices once) so I plan to do that to perfect my efficiency in coding.
